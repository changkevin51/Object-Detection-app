# Object Detection Project

A Streamlit object detection app tailored towards transportation. Accepts images and videos.

DEMO LINK: https://8504-01j6t863nm5gjsvgy63e2avctp.cloudspaces.litng.ai 

NOTE: THE DEMO ABOVE MAY TAKE UP TO 5 MINUTES TO START (Used lightning.ai because Git LFS limit exceeded)



## Description

Uses Python and YOLOv3 algorithm that involves convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities of objects in input images/frames.

Object detection is essential for computer vision applications, and this model can serve as a foundation for detecting specific object classes in images.
